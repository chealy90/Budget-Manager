Budget Manager


This is a budget manager tool to allow users to track and analyse their finances.
The app will use React and offer a breakdown to users of where income enters and leaves.


The site allows users to add incomes / expenses. They can view the totals of these, and view them graphically as a pie chart.

Users have the option to add categories to their expenses to allow them to track their spending across these categories rather than as individual items.
