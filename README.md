Budget Manager


This is a budget manager tool to allow users to track and analyse their finances.
The app will use React and offer a breakdown to users of where income enters and leaves.


So far the site allows users to add incomes expenses. They can view the totals of these, and view them graphically as a pie chart.

In the future I might consider adding the option to assign tags to the entries, providing greater data analysis value.
